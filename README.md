10:1024 Decoder using 2:4 Decoders Overview This project implements a 10:1024 decoder using only 2:4 decoders. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate hierarchical digital design and efficient use of smaller decoders to achieve larger decoding functionalities in Verilog.

Design Approach The 10:1024 decoder is built using a hierarchical design approach:

2:4 Decoder: This is the basic building block, converting 2 input bits into 4 output lines. 10:1024 Decoder: The 5:32 decoder is constructed by cascading multiple 2:4 decoders.

Prerequisites A Verilog simulator like ModelSim or Xilinx Vivado Knowledge of Verilog language.

Results The 10:1024 decoder successfully decodes the 10-bit input into the corresponding 1024 output lines, demonstrating the hierarchical design approach. The simulation waveform confirms the correct operation for all possible input combinations.

Applications of a Decoder 1)Demultiplexing 2)Memory Address Decoding 3)Data Multiplexing and etc
